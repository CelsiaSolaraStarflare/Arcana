## Introduction
Welcome to Arcana, your dynamic study resource database! Our goal is to help students like you excel in your exams by providing quick and accurate answers to your study questions.

## How to Use
Now if this is your first time here in Arcana, you might want to get familiar with several terms:
-Indexing means to convert refined data and materials(ppts, pdfs, docxs, csvs...etc) into raw data.
-IDXDB or "Database" on the other hand means the temporary cache you have for your current login to this webpage.
        
**Interface**
```
-You can go to Chatbot page by manuerving through the menu.
  -Selecting Default means that the content you ask will be answered through our Arcanalte bot.
  -Selecting IDX will make the bot answer from the database consisting of IDX's contents and your contents.
  -Reasoning will enable the deep thinking methodology of the Arcanalte by using the Qwen-QWQ architecture.
  -Long Text will utilize both the IDX DB search algorithm and the Qwen-Long Text model for refined answering in a long sequence.
-How to upload your files or content?
  -Go to the Files page and then there is an upload option.
  -Upload to the webpage by dragging and drop or clicking and selecting.
  -Then you need to wait for the pre-indexing to finish, which then the files and lists will show up in a section called "Finder" underneath.
  -After that you could move and change the locations of your database in order for the chatbot to more quickly locate your items.
  -At the end of each round of change or upload, go to the bottom of the page and click "Index to Database". 
    -This is a slower process, you will see a "Running..." Icon on the upper right of the screen, when it dissapears, you are ready to go!
    -Now go back to the Chatbot page and select IDX mode, the chatbot will now answer by quoting and mentioning the lins from IDX and your database!
