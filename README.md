## üìò How to Use

New here? Don‚Äôt worry, angel! Here's a quick rundown of the key concepts and how you can start using Arcana today.

### üîç Key Terms

- **IDXDB**: The "Database" ‚Äî a temporary, session-based data cache used during chatbot interactions.

### üß≠ Navigation and Interface

```txt
üåü Chatbot Page:
 - "Default" Mode ‚Üí Uses ArcanaLTE's general AI bot
 - "IDX" Mode ‚Üí Searches your own database content (from uploaded files)
 - "Reasoning" Mode ‚Üí Uses the Qwen-QWQ model for in-depth, logical responses
 - "Long Text" Mode ‚Üí Combines indexing and the Qwen-Long Text model for longer, more contextual answers

üìÇ Files Page:
 - Drag and drop your files to upload them
 - Wait for pre-indexing to finish
 - Files will appear in the "Finder" section
 - Organize your data and click "Index to Database" to finalize it
 - Once indexing is complete, switch to "IDX" mode in Chatbot to begin querying your data!
