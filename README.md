## Make Your Chatbot PRIVATE TO YOU AND CUSTOMIZED!
So basically you would want your chatbot to be hidden from the public database. We respect that and therefore, we have built this program on top fo streamlit UI. Feel free to fork this repertory and then build your own private server chatbot with this program!

## How to Use
Now if this is your first time here in Arcana, you might want to get familiar with several terms:
-Indexing means to convert refined data and materials(ppts, pdfs, docxs, csvs...etc) into raw data.
-IDXDB or "Database" on the other hand means the temporary cache you have for your current login to this webpage.
        
**Interface**
```
-You can go to the Chatbot page by maneuvering through the menu.
  -Selecting Default means that the content you ask will be answered through our Arcanalte bot.
  -Selecting IDX will make the bot answer from the database consisting of IDX's contents and your contents.
  -Reasoning will enable the deep thinking methodology of the Arcanalte by using the Qwen-QWQ architecture.
  -Long Text will utilize both the IDX DB search algorithm and the Qwen-Long Text model for refined answering in a long sequence.
-How to upload your files or content?
  -Go to the Files page and then there is an upload option.
  -Upload to the webpage by dragging and dropping or clicking and selecting.
  -Then you need to wait for the pre-indexing to finish, and then the files and lists will show up in a section called "Finder" underneath.
  -After that, you could move and change the locations of your database for the chatbot to more quickly locate your items.
  -At the end of each round of change or upload, go to the bottom of the page and click "Index to Database". 
    -This is a slower process, you will see a "Running..." The icon on the upper right of the screen, when it disappears, you are ready to go!
    -Now go back to the Chatbot page and select IDX mode, the chatbot will now answer by quoting and mentioning the links from IDX and your database!
